   Ubuntu Chadwm
</h1>

# Chadwm is a fork from Dwm

At ArcoLinux we created our own take on this TWM. That is what we will install on any Ubuntu and so many things more.
Until it is quite perfect for our use.


# CODE

The code can be found as part of ArcoLinux Nemesis here:

https://github.com/erikdubois/arcolinux-nemesis/tree/master/Personal/settings/ubuntu-chadwm


Type in a terminal

./1 and press twice on TAB and it will run the scripts. Decide what to run is also an option ofcourse.
